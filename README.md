# MSP430-touch-keypad
A capacitive touch keypad made on the MSP430G2553 development board intended for use in OsuGame. This microcontroller does not have on board USB support
so I use the USB CDC on the development board and run a script on my pc that reads the serial data and controls the keyboard using the Win32 api.
